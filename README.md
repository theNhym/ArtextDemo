# ArtextDemo

Artext plans to utilize the permaweb to usher in a new era of publishing: decentralized. Readers are only required to hold Arweave Tokens in their wallets to access published content from writers. How much tokens needed to be held by a reader to access content is governed by a system called "ink". Each published content will have its own ink rating. Readers can spend tokens to vote on their favorite published content to increase or decrease "ink". Writers will profit from every vote or donation made by readers. 

Artext bridges the gap betwen readers and writers through a system where the community will be the deciding factor in a published content's success, in a system achievable only through blockchain and essentially, Arweave.
